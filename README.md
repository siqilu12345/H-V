# H-V
This repository contains my work for the undergraduate research. We give an theoretical explanation for H/V ratio peak frequencies based on numerical simulation. The conclusion is that, in a two-layer model, for H/V ratio caused by ambient noise in a small area, the peak frequencies, no matter the first or the followings, are the same with S wave resonance frequencies in the top layer, therefore H/V ratio peak may be caused by S wave resonance. The manuscript is in submission for BSSA. The file 'HoverV' contains MATLAB files for computing H/V ratio. 'HVpy' contains the Python files for generating input files for simulation and for plotting the result (using Matplotlib). The figures and the draft of our thesis are in the folder 'result'.
